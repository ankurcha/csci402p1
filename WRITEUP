II. Assumptions:
        
III. Design:

    Part 1:
	+ Configuration file design
	    The configuration file is used to tell the number of entities of each type that we wish to create.
	    The format of the configuration is fairly simple.
		Number of Patients, Number of Receptionists, Number of Door boys, Number of Doctors, 
		Number of Cashiers, Number of Clerks, Number of Hospital Managers
		
		Example configuration file
		  20,3,2,2,3,2,1
