I. Requirements:
    + Part 1:

        We are expected to implement all methods for the Lock and Condition
        classes.  Our code should not assume that threads will always follow
        the rules, and should check for and report illegal operations, like
        releasing a lock the thread does not own.  If a thread performs an
        illegal operation, an error will be printed, but the error will be
        ignored and the thread will continue to function.  For the condition
        class our code will follow Mesa semantics, meaning that when a thread
        wakes up on a condition variable, it will go to the back of the run
        queue, not the front.

    + Part 2:

        We are expected to build a hospital simulation that conforms to the
        interaction rules specified in the problem statement.  The simulation
        has to be multi-threaded and should use only the Lock and Condition
        classes from part 1 for synchronization.  The simulation should be
        robust to context switches and should not contain any race conditions.
        Each type of person in the hospital should be represented by a type of
        thread and all their interactions should be simulated by thread
        interactions.

        Additionally we are expected to implement tests to verify each of the
        conditions specified under testing.  These tests shoud be easy to run
        with nachos on the command line.

II. Assumptions:

    We assume:
        -Functions provided by NACHOS are generally bug free and perform as
        specified.

III. Design:

    TODO

V. Testing: (For each test case, you must show)
    + How to test

        -Test Case 1: Patients only get in when the doorboy asks them to.

            In this test, we initialize all the threads in the hospital
            simulation except the doorboy threads hence all the patients would
            get till the point that they have the token as given by the
            receptionist and select the doctor they want to see but do not
            continue beyond that and perpetually sleep as there is no one to
            wake them up and send them to the doctor.  

        -Test Case 3: Only one patient gets to see a given doctor at at
         instance of time

            To run this test run nachos as follows:
            
            %threads/nachos -P2 3 -rs {your seed} 1| grep "Consulting doctor x"

            Where x is the ID of one of the doctors. 
            
        -Test Case 4: Patient always choose the shortest line with the cashier,
            pharmacy clerk and the receptionist.
            
            To run this test run nachos as follows:
            
            %threads/nachos -P2 -rs {your seed} 1| grep "TEST4:"

            Where x is the ID of one of the doctors.  Then select item 3 on the
            menu.

            In this test, all the threads are initialized as normal but when
            the patient is trying to search through the receptionists' lines
            the verbosity of the program is increase and this search process
            is made visible. Hence, the user can see the individual lengths
            of each of the lines and also the final line chosen by the patient.

    + Test Output

        -Test Case 1:

            We would see the following messages from any of the patients:
            
            P_0:Attempt to acquire recpLineLock...
            P_0:success
            P_0: found shortest line R_0 len: 0
            P_0 Got woken up, get out of line and going to counter for token    
            P_0: Reading Token..
            P_0: My token is 1..yeah!!
            P_0: Signal receptionist R_0 to continue, I am done
            P_0 : Going to meet doctor D_1
            P_0 : Join line and Waiting for doorboy to tell me to go
            
            As we can see that all the patients would halt at this point. Hence
            proving to us that they cannot continue without a doorboy.

        -Test Case 3:

            The output from the grep command will show all the patients who
            enter and exit interaction with doctor x.  Verify that no patient
            enters consultation with a doctor before the previous one has
            finished.

        -Test Case 4:

            The user would see the normal output as given during a regular 
            run, additionally the user will see the following for each patients
            thread:
            
            P_3: Searching for the receptionist with the shortest line
            P_3: TEST4: Length of line at R_0 = 1
            P_3: TEST4: Length of line at R_1 = 1
            P_3: TEST4: Length of line at R_2 = 1
            P_3: TEST4: Length of line at R_3 = 0
            P_3: Found shortest line with R_3 len: 0   <======
            P_4:Attempt to acquire recpLineLock...
            P_4:success
            P_4: Searching for the receptionist with the shortest line
            P_4: TEST4: Length of line at R_0 = 1
            P_4: TEST4: Length of line at R_1 = 1
            P_4: TEST4: Length of line at R_2 = 1
            P_4: TEST4: Length of line at R_3 = 1
            P_4: Found shortest line with R_0 len: 1   <======
            
            As we see here P_3 searches through all the lines and find the
            shortest one. Then it chooses the corresponding receptionist
            as marked. Similarly, when the line selection happens with the
            pharmacy clerk or the chashier.
